define Package/ffrg-txpower-fix/description
	With chaoscalmer, wifi nodes seemed to be locked to less txpower than they could do.
	First suggestions are, that this is a mistake in the upstream OpenWrt-Code. Even the
	bugtrackers of OpenWrt are full of this. 
	The idea of this workaround is, to check if the txpower could be increased iff it isn't
	already set to a special value. Unfortunately this can only be done by setting the 
	country code to 00.
